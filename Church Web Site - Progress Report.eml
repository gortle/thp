Hi Stephen,

I have been slowly working on the website. There is no styling on it, I 
haven't even split up paragraphs of text, but the main pieces of the 
site are here.  It is not ready for viewing by the general public but 
anyone can see it here:

    http://thp-test.azurewebsites.net/


The navigation is a little clunky. To see all of it you will need to go 
to the site map linked on the page or

    http://thp-test.azurewebsites.net/Home/SiteMap


I'll get on to the styling next, and uploading sermons. Later I'll need 
some help with better images, cleaning up the design and revisiting the 
text of the site. Some of it is clearly out of date.


The source code is here and is freely available to anyone. No secrets 
here. You can even see when I check in.

    https://github.com/gortle/thp


You will need Visual Studio 2012 or later to use it easily. If you are 
keen there are free versions here:

    http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/products/visual-studio-express-for-web


I have created a church mail account

    thpchurch@gmail.com

Please feel free to use this account or we can create another if need 
be.  I'll send you the passwords offline as it is more secure.

The calender in the website is tied to this account. You can create 
events via here or directly from the site

    https://www.google.com/calendar



At the moment I have it hosted on Microsoft Azure which is no cost until 
such stage as we need to assign it an external domain (ie 
www.tweedpresbyterian.com). At which point I think it is $10 per month. 
The price doesn't go up unless we are getting 10,000 of hits per month - 
at which point we would be very happy. I may be able to host it under 
the existing arrangements Glen has made, but I haven't followed that up. 
The site security is going to be much easier if Microsoft handles it. We 
will need to discuss that later.

Regards
Chris
