This service may be called Kingscliff morning but we are currently meeting at the Chinderah SDA Centre. Confused? Well we have been meeting in the Kingscliff are for over 100 years so we decided not to rename ourselves when we started meeting at Chinderah a few years ago. I hope that makes sense.

Our service on a Sunday morning is probably best described as traditional and friendly. We mainly sing older type hymns but do intersperse that with some modern songs as well. We place at the centre of what we do the preaching and teaching of God’s word and we do so by encouraging one another to practise what we preach. We seek to support and love one another in the same way that God has loved us through Christ. After approximately an hour’s worship, we pack up and have a cuppa tea and something yummy to eat.

The Kingscliff Church is actively involved in our local area mainly through a friendship table at the local shopping centre, a home group that meets in one of our local homes and have taken a close interest in the Wommin Bay Nursing home. We visit our local hospitals regularly, we take an active part in supporting our missionaries, we meet regularly for prayer, we support the work of SRE (Special Religious Education) in our local primary and High schools and we have an annual church Camp and Mission. 

So if you are looking for a Church that loves the Lord, the word and our world then come along at 8:30am one Sunday morning and check us out.
